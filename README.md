# RemoteVolumeControl by MD20M


# Usage

First clone down the repository and navigate into the `remotevolumecontrol` folder.

Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm i --save win-audio
```

and

```bash
npm I
```

To start the code write the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the code up. You can then control the volume on the started up website.

To control the volume remotely port forward the port used on the website and then access the website using your device ip followed by the port (example: https://123.123.123.123:3000)
